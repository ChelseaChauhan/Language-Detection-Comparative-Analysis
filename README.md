# Language-Detection-Comparative-Analysis
## ABSTRACT
Natural Language is spoken and written by humans and thus, it is generated in an enormous amount in this world. Though it may have a big deal of knowledge inside it, but because of its large volume, it is becoming very hard day by day to propagate the gained knowledge by a person/human in a limited time span. The natural language processing is the answer for this job which provides the fruitful results using big amount of data, with good accuracy just like a human being. The following analysis presents the comparative analysis of various machine learning and natural language processing algorithms on Language Detection which is an application of natural language processing and finally.

## PROPOSED SYSTEM
In this research report, the comparative analysis is done on one of the NLP’s applications i.e., ‘Language Detection’ using machine learning and natural language processing algorithms such as Naïve Bayes Alogrithm, Random Forest Algorithm, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree etc. The training and testing of the data is done using Google Colaboratory. The features from the dataset are visualised using pie-charts, correlation matrix and confusion matrix, etc. This study's primary goal is to check the working of the above mentioned algorithms and their ability to interpret the data in a time bound scenario in the real-world.

## CONCLUSION
While we got the average accuracy of 95.7% with logistic regression, 92.5% with random forest, decision tree only gave us an accuracy of 86.5%. The highest accuracy was given by naïve bayes, i.e., 97.5%. This accuracy can be certainly increased if more and efficient data is fed to the algorithms.
